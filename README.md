# SER-004: Document Integrity & Logging Failure (ChatGPT)

## Summary

This repository documents a critical failure in ChatGPT’s document generation and memory/logging system.

- PDF files are often broken, with artifacts or missing content.
- DOCX exports are truncated after 2–3 modules with no warning.
- In-chat memory fails to persist critical elements across even short sessions.
- System says “saved”, “fixed” or “done” — but nothing is actually stored.
- Users are forced to manually reconstruct their own logs, documents, and declarations.

This is **not a usability complaint** — it’s a breach of trust in basic system architecture.

## Position

> “If the system says it ‘fixed’ or ‘saved’ something — it must do so. Otherwise, this is not a tool. It’s theater.”

This repo is maintained as **public record** of failure to uphold the architectural contract between tool and user.
